**The Berry Package Manager**

Berry is an open-source package manager designed to run packages
(apps) inside the Berry CLI. It is useful when you want to run
apps without any graphics for optimisation and want to have an
inner experience inside the CLI. Our CLI can be installed using
our berryinstaller1.0.exe in the Releases tab.
